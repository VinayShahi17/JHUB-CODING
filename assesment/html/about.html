                        <p class="card-text">
                        Gurkhas first became Sappers in October 1948 when 67 Field Squadron Royal Engineers was formed at Kluang, Malaya. The
                        Squadron formed from Gurkha infantrymen who attached to the Royal Engineers. 68 Field Squadron Royal Engineers was
                        raised at Kluang in April 1950.
                        Later in the same year both Squadrons moved to Hong Kong. The Regimental Headquarters of 50 Field Engineer Regiment
                        Royal Engineers was formed in Hong Kong in June 1951. The Regiment moved to Malaya as the 17th Gurkha Divisional
                        Engineers to support operations then in progress during the Malayan Emergency.
